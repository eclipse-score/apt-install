# Installing packages... the convenient way

## Why use this action?

Just running `apt install` in a GitHub Actions workflow is not the best way to
install packages. It can be slow. Really really slow. Using this action will
speed up the installation of packages via `apt`.

### Example

Installing graphviz with different methods:


| Method | Mean (s) | Median (s) | 30â€“60s | >60s |
|--------|----------|------------|--------|------|
| apt install graphviz | ğŸ”´ 26.0 | ğŸŸ¡ 20.0 | 1,4% | 9,5% |
| via this action | ğŸŸ¢ 6.5 | ğŸŸ¢ 6.0 | 0 | 0 |


## How to use

Add the following step to your GitHub Actions workflow to install packages via `apt`:

```yaml
    - name: Install dependencies
      uses: eclipse-score/apt-install@main
      with:
        packages: dia doxygen doxygen-doc doxygen-gui doxygen-latex graphviz mscgen
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `packages` | A space-separated list of packages to install via `apt`. | *required* |
| `cache` | Use a cache to speed up the installation. See also [Caching Caveats](https://github.com/awalsh128/cache-apt-pkgs-action#caveats) | `true` |
| `mandb` | Update the `mandb` database after installing packages. | `false` |
| `apt_update` | Run `apt update` before installing packages. | `false` |
| `recommends` | Install recommended dependencies. | `false` |

## Why yet another action?

While it's true that there are already several actions that install packages via `apt`, none quite matches our expectations.
We wanted an action that is fast, efficient, and easy to use. This action is designed to be a drop-in replacement for `apt install` in GitHub Actions workflows, while allowing all the flexibility you need.

## Measurements in Detail
